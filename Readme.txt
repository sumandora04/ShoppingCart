Getting error for update, remove as unable to get the Product_id from the Home.java to other Activity.
Use StringRequest instead of JsonRequest for search(), and parse product_name,product_id,image_url; pass a constant value for price as price is not there to parse.
Error in showing the database items(price and quantity).
